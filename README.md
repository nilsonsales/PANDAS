# Data Analysis with Pandas and Python

Following the Udemy course "Data Analysis with Pandas and Python". Instead of using Anaconda, I'm using a Python's virtual environment, with all the requirements listed in the file *requirements.txt*.

To activate using the **fish** shell:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate.fish
```

Then run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
